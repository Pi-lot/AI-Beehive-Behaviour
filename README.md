# AI-Beehive-Behaviour
A previous university assignment where I had to simulate AI beehive behaviour in Unity3D.

All files were provided by the university, I edited the Mothership and Drone scripts to add the behaviour for the drones and the instructions for the mothership.

The code I wrote is mostly within Mothership.cs and Drone.cs.

Within Mothership.cs my code is within Update(), FindResourceInRange() and RemoveDrone().

Within Drone.cs there is a mix of code I wrote myself, code provided to me and code written by me with the help of tutorials provided by the university. BoidBehavior, Friends and MoveTowardsTarget were not completely written by me (provided and tutorials mostly). I used tutorials mainly for Update, Attacking, DetectNewResources and Roam, basics for Scouting. The rest of the functions are my own work.
